# Blood Connect

## 1.   Introduction
This platform makes it easy for the people to connect with the nearest blood donation camps. "Blood Connect" makes the process of donating and requesting blood seamless. People need to sign up on the platform once and then they can use their QR code for any future donation or request. This makes it easier to maintain the whole process of contacting the donation camps. People can search for their nearest blood camps by inputting basic information like the blood type, state, units of blood required and they will be shown the nearest blood camps.

We have utilized Xamarin.Forms, so that we can target 3 major platforms at the same time, i.e., Android, iOS and UWP (Universal Windows Platform). We can share the single code base and re-use upto 95% of code to develop application for these 3 platforms at the same time.

>You need at least Android API level 21 (Lollipop) to run this application.

> The libraries used in this project are mostly (if not all) Open Source and Free to use and distribute.We do not claim any copyright on the external libraries.

# 4.    Running The Project
Let  us remind you again that the minimum Android OS that you need to run this project is Lollipop (API Level 21). So, make sure you're satisfying the minimum requirements first. Otherwise, your handset won't be able to parse the apk file.

- ### Permissions Required :
    This application requires you to provide few permissions to it, in order to work properly. Here's the list of permissions that the application needs :
    - Internet Access
    - View WiFi Connections
    - Storage (Read/Write Perms For Cache)
    - Camera (For Taking Pictures)

- #### Instructions For Direct APK Installation :
    If you want to run this application on your android phone, please move over to the "[`Downloads`](https://github.com/MadTitans/Blood-Connect/tree/master/release)" section and download the latest stable APK build for your android phone. You do not need any external libraries or application.

- #### Instructions For Developers/Testers :
     If you're a developer or any user who wishes to test this application and run this android project, it's recommended to install Visual Studio with Xamarin Support and Android SDKs on your system. Remember that Android SDKs should be in your local path for you to be able to compile the project properly. You can find the source code in the "[SOURCE](https://github.com/MadTitans/Blood-Connect/tree/master/src)" directory.

    If you do not happen to have Visual Studio, it is recommended to get it because it'll download all the required packages on its own, if they're not present. You can use Visual Studio's Free Community Edition. It'll work, as we've developed this application on it.

But, if for some reason, you don't want to or can't install Visual Studio, you will need to have .NET, Xamarin, Android SDK and required Packages in your system's local path for you to be able to compile and execute this application project.
